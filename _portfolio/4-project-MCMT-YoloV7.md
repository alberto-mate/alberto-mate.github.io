This project implements a detection system using multi-camera monitoring, bounding box filtering and cluster-based tracking. The system is based on the YoloV7 object detection. Once the bounding boxes are detected, they are projected to the ground plane. There are multiple steps such as filtering, clustering and tracking to obtain the final position of the people.
